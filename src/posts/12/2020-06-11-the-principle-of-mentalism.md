The entire Universe is a projection of the Thought of the Whole. The entire Universe is the materialization of the great Thought. The material world is only a support for thoughts to materialize and realize the power they contain.

Our lives are the projection of our mentality (coming from Ajna), that is why it can be called a dream. We are living in a dream, thoughts create our reality. Thoughts create actions and speech . Before doing any action or saying a word, we have to think about it.

Thoughts come before any material manifestation, they are very powerful. The thoughts are real while the material manifestation is only the reflection of them. Basically, because thoughts have the power of the spirit (I am talking about true thoughts and not those that come from the ego).

Many people believe that only actions are important, in truth, they do not understand that spirit is much more important and powerful than any action. To control your life, you must first control your thoughts, your beautiful thoughts will allow you to perform beautiful actions .

The way we perceive the world comes from our thinking. How do we understand life? What is our vision of life? Our lives depend on how we perceive life. The perception of life depends on the person who perceives it, on what they believe. Everyone perceives things as they think. 

The way we think is the origin of the way we act. But what would our thoughts be without actions? Actions make our thoughts have a physical existence, therefore, actions and thoughts must be in total harmony. Actions must be linked to our thoughts.

Our physical world is nothing more than a materialization of our spiritual nature . As long as we do not live in unity, our material perceptions will distort our perception of reality.

The reality of mentalism can lead to disaster if we do not understand it properly . In fact, many spiritual seekers fall into the trap of totally ignoring the material world.

Although the material world is an illusion for the Whole, for us it is our current reality. We are finite beings living in a finite worldâ€¦ for now. It is not the ultimate reality, but it is our reality now, we must not reject it. But we must bear in mind that it is not the ultimate truth. We cannot live as gods in our physical world. At this time, we need to acquire material experiences. We are not mature enough to live only in the mental manifestation of the Universe .

From our finite world, we can reach infinity . It can and should be our starting point. Without this starting point, we will not reach infinity. We need to learn to sublimate our material reality rather than reject it. Rejecting the material world means rejecting a part of ourselves. We are here to experience matter.

The Principle of Mentalism teaches us that we are all unique but we are all connected through our true nature, which is our spirit.

The lower forms of beings (such as minerals or animals) are also spiritual. Higher forms of beings (such as angels or gods) are also spiritual.

We are all united through our spirit, which is our true nature, even though we are now manifesting in a physical body .
